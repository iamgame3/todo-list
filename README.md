# Todo List App

This app is meant to teach me how to use the Web Storage API and give me more practice using Webpack and objects. Minimal display size responsiveness in this app.

Functionality is very intuitive. You're able to create projects and tasks, edit or remove those projects and tasks, as well as see if any tasks are overdue or due today. Tasks are listed by priority (which you can manually assign if you want, otherwise it'll be automatically assigned). Click tasks to see their description. Click the checkbox next to the task to mark it as complete. All projects and tasks are stored even when the page is closed.

P.S. This app is a part of The Odin Project's course.
